So everyone wants to be a [@SOF3](https://forums.pmmp.io/members/sofe.4) (alternate spelling of **SOFe**). Why not have a tool that allows you to do just that? You can create your very own SOFe avatar, easily!

### Requirements
- PHP
- Imagick (PHP extension)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Install the Imagick extensions with `sudo apt-get install php5-imagick`.
2. Start your webserver.
3. Generate SOFe avatars and set them as your profile picture everywhere.
